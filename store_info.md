# Name

Cache Disabler

## Summary

Ensure you get the latest changes during web development.

## Description

<b>Effortlessly disable the browser cache.</b>
Add a hostname (domain) and all requests originated from that domain will always be fresh.

Plus, there's no need to re-enable hostnames upon browser restart. All settings are persisted.

This extension is quite similar to the "disable cache" function in Developer Tools.
But without the need to keep them continuously open.
